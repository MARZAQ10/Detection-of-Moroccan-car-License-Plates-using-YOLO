<h1>Recognition of Moroccan car License Plates using YOLO</h1>

<h2>Project</h2>
<p>
This project involves implementing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect et recognition Moroccan car license plates. YOLO is a popular object detection algorithm known for its efficiency and ability to detect objects in real-time with a single forward pass of the network. The focus will be on training the model to accurately identify and localize license plates within images, integrating it into a system that can be used for automated license plate recognition (ALPR) applications. Evaluation will ensure the model meets accuracy and performance requirements for practical deployment.

### Setup
Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Use Python 3.8.

Before running the project, you will need the trained weights.

### Dataset
The network has been trained on the Moroccan license plate dataset: [https://msda.um6p.ma/msda_datasets](https://msda.um6p.ma/msda_datasets).
